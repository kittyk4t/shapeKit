<h1>ShapeKit Help</h1>

  <ul>
    <h2>Welcome to ShapeKit</h2>
    <h2>Buttons/ commands in order on the left:</h2>

      <li>[Choose File]<br>
      Select a file and it will appear on the canvas. If you add changes or shapes to the canvas and choose a new file, your work will stay on the canvas. There is no button to remove the background image once you have put one. You can download your image without the background, see below button [Download Canvas [No Background]]</li>

      <li>[Toggle BW Filter]<br>
      Press the button (it will be green when toggled on) and it will place a black and white filter on your canvas. If you have placed colored shapes, those shapesâ€™ colors will be unaffected by the black and white filter. The intention of the black and white filter is to draw focus to the outlines of the selected background image.</li>

      <li>[Select Color]<br>
      Selects color for the stroke of the line, shapes, and random shape addition.</li>

      <li>[Add Line]<br>
      Allows line drawing. Click [Add Line], bring the cursor to the canvas, click down, and drag in the direction you want your line to be in. Every time you want to draw a new line, you need to click the [Add Line] button.</li>

      <li>[Rectangle]<br>
      Adds a rectangle with the current stroke weight and color to the upper left-hand corner of the canvas.</li>

      <li>[Circle]<br>
      Adds a circle with the current stroke weight and color to the upper left-hand corner of the canvas.</li>

      <li>[Triangle]<br>
      Adds a triangle with the current stroke weight and color to the upper left-hand corner of the canvas.</li>

      <li>[Add Random Shape]<br>
      Adds a random shape (rectangle, circle, or triangle) of a random stroke weight and color to a random position on the canvas.</li>

      <li>[Undo]<br>
      Removes the last shape added to the canvas.</li>

      <li>[Clear]<br>
      Removes all the shapes from the canvas but keeps the background image in place.</li>

      <li>[Download Canvas]<br>
      Downloads an image of the current canvas, with both the current background image and all the shapes.</li>

      <li>[Download Canvas [No Background]]<br>
Downloads an image of all the shapes currently on the canvas, but with a transparent background, instead of the current background image.</li>
<li>Cmd + Z (works the same as [Undo])</li>
<li>Delete Key (when highlighting a shape, press delete, and it will delete)</li>

</ul>
